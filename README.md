# Task Manager App

A feature-rich Task-Manager App where you can organize tasks with the ability to distribute them by topic in your opinion (boards - for global themes and cards of each board - for different types of the tasks). There are functions for add, remove and change cards and bords. Each card has several fields of information: title, description, date, label and tasks with remove and complete status. Also there are two moods: light and dark. Invite you to log in with test-user data or you can register yourself.
